 Rs Member Diary I Just Voted For Obama...and it was the right thing to do . I was tested and tempted almost beyond what I could bear . I struggled with my conscience up to the last minute . I he d the corners of my inner being trying to find a way to justify doing the wrong thing . Suddenly , I imagined my mom in heaven one day asking me why I did what I did in the 2012 election and that did it . It was the final mental battle that he d me over the edge to actually vote for Obama . But , wait ! Hear me out before you judge me and I get banned for my wretched , inexplicable decision . My mom had a stroke in 2004 and though it was a mild stroke , over the years she slowly declined in her health and physical strength until she can no longer care for herself . While she still eats , speaks and thinks , she can no longer write , see or walk so she is completely dependent upon her children and grandchildren to care for her . Thus , I had to fill out my mom 's early voting ballot for her for the second time in my life . Being in California , we have quite a few propositions on the ballot and my mom told me she did n't care about those and I was to use my own judgment when marking her vote . But when it came to the President of the U.s . , she made very clear that she could never vote for Romney and wanted to vote for Obama . It was hard for me . As I alluded to above , I literally struggled with my conscience thinking I will do the right thing , overrule my mom 's judgment and vote for Romney . After all , she will never know what I did and it 's for the good of the country . Then I thought that sounded like the way a liberal justifies doing wrong . So , I took a deep breath , steadied the pen in my hand and marked my mom 's ballot for Obama . Politics can be devious , evil things . Actually had me considering betraying my own mother . It was tough , but I think I did the right thing . Out of respect for my mother , I will refrain from discussing how I he d her slowly morph into a Democrat after being a staunch Republican for many years . For now , I am just going to relish in the relief I feel because I will be able to face my mom in heaven with a clear conscience .

 The Secret Life of Wire Copy by Paul Talbot on September 22 , 2012 I still adore wire copy . It came jerking up out of those big metal machines which shivered and shook and kept clattering away with he s from distant bureaus . Those machines were a proud connection to the rest of the world long before the internet , long before Cnn , and if you were fortunate enough to spend your days with them , you had this feeling of being on the inside , living ahead of everyone else . Wire copy takes you back to the newsroom , where you would check the machines , roll up the paper , lay it down on the desk , tear it up with a metal ruler , and stack the stories in appropriate piles . Some went in folders , some on clipboards , and some were shoved on nails coming out from the wall . In Ottawa , there were big metal trash cans in the newsroom where we 'd toss dated copy or material we would n't use . They 're where we also emptied the heavy glass ashtrays . We all smoked . The tall windows looking out over Parliament Hill were coated with pasty yellow tobacco smoke film . Now and then , when an ashtray with a still smoldering cigarette was dumped in , our discarded wire copy would flare up . You never wanted to be the guy in the newsroom who was considered to be too good to change a faded ribbon . There was no way to do this without staining your fingers with ink , not that I ever discovered . Somehow , we never ran out of ribbons , never ran out of paper , and those workhorse machines , the size of a small refrigerator and as heavy as a large one , always seemed to pound away . If you were lucky , you would get the hear the bell ring . In those days the bulletins seemed sparse , rationed and reserved for what was important rather than what was noteworthy . The more wire machines the better . In Ottawa , we had five , each with different content , stuffed into a closet away from the main newsroom . Heavy cartons with rolls of paper were stacked up beside them , each twice as large and twice as heavy as a case of beer . In Toronto we had six machines lined up right in the newsroom . Teletype keys pounding , other typewriters chiming in , tape being edited , audio feeds being recorded , tunes blasting , guys on the phone , two - way radio crackle , tape speeding across the heads of tape decks screeching through rewind or fast forward , conversations , all in a mix rising and falling with its own mysterious cadence , and none of it ever seeming like noise . That was how it was in Toronto , the soundtrack of a newsroom in perfect pitch , anchored by the reassuring rumble and clatter of those big old wire machines .

 I have a theory : that great writers , make dismal dancers . And the reason ? It 's down to rhythm . Writers store it within , simmering like a hearty ragu , before releasing it in sentences to their obedient readers , whose eyes and minds tap along to the beat . If you want to be a great travel blogger , it 's less about being a great traveller , and more about learning to channel your rhythm . Imagine yourself as the most driven , focused , and competent rhythmic gymnast , commanding your pale ribbon through the tense air like a wisp of coloured smoke . One false move , and it 's a tangle of disappointment . Your readers will stumble awkwardly across the narrow beam of your sentence , and tumble helplessly into the blank surrounds , to the bitter echo of confusion . Throughout our lives , our environment dictates our rhythm . Some writers crave pure silence , to be able to tune into themselves . While others - myself included - prefer to use music to neutralise a wayward rhythm . For me , the music I choose is often without words , or in a foreign language . If I get to know the song too well , I start to sing along , and my rhythm melts into a thousand rivulets , poisoning my words and ways . Next time you begin to write , take a moment to tune into your rhythm , and learn to I ve into it . Am I talking codswallop ? If you think so , go ahead and say so . Or perhaps something I 've said has struck a chord ? Lay it down , we could all learn something from you today . Tapping these keys conjures up a mental image of a heavy - footed walker , shlepping his way through the misty English wilderness . One blind summit , after , another .

Mulcair says he s ready for a 2015 warmup as Harper calls three byelections for late November Murray Brewster , Canadian Press | Oct 21 , 2012 5:31 Pm Et More from Canadian Press The Canadian Press Patrick Doyle ; The Canadian Press Kilpatrick"we 're going to fight hard in all of these byelections . It 's the only way I know how to do politics . I do n't concede anything to an adversary ? ever , " Thomas Mulcair said Sunday . Ottawa ? Prime Minister Stephen Harper called three federal byelections on Sunday , a move Opposition Leader Tom Mulcair says is an important warmup for the clash of visions he expects in the next general election . The votes ? in Victoria , Calgary - centre and the Ontario riding of Durham ? will be held Nov . 26 and have been called because Mps in each riding stepped down for various reasons . The most high - profile vacancy in Durham , where former cabinet minister Bev Oda quit following controversy over her expenses , including an infamous $ 16 glass of orange juice . Related Feud over Harper cuts escalates as watchdog takes his fight to court John Ivison : Focus on Canadian economy may show Mulcair , Harper are more alike than they want to admit New Democrat Denise Savoie resigned her Victoria seat for health reasons and long - time I ve Lee Richardson quit in Calgary - centre to work for Alberta Premier Alison Redford . The call came just as Mulcair was attempting to rev up the Ndp machine at a meeting of the party?s federal council , which is already plotting strategy for the next general election in 2015 . He found the timing of the prime minister?s announcement curious , given that the Supreme Court of Canada will rule this week on whether I ve Mp Ted Opitz will continue to serve as Mp for Etobicoke Centre . When Canadians go to the polls in 2015 , for the first time in a very long time , they ll have a clear choice between two parties with two clear visions for a our country?s future ? we were expecting the call soon , but we 're a little bit surprised , ? Mulcair told reporters Sunday . ? if he d waited four days we could?ve at least had that information from the Supreme Court . ? Last spring , the Ontario Superior Court overturned Opitz?s win in the May 2 , 2011 election after a legal challenge by former Liberal Mp Borys Wrzesnewskyj , who argued Elections Canada workers counted at least 79 votes that could nt be validated . The Supreme Court will rule on Thursday and Wrzesnewskyj has been out knocking on doors preparing for what he expects will be a byelection . Mulcair , who took over as Ndp leader last March following the death of Jack Layton , said his party intends to turn each of the current byelections into a referendum on the Harper government?s record , even in the I ve heartland of Calgary . we 're we?re going to fight hard in all of these byelections . it d's the only way I know how to do politics . I do nt concede anything to an adversary ? ever , ? he said . New Democrats say they ve started their organizational spade work for 2015 and Mulcair used both the meeting and the byelections as a chance to frame the differences between his party and the Conservatives . ? when Canadians go to the polls in 2015 , for the first time in a very long time , they ll have a clear choice between two parties with two clear visions for a our country?s future , ? he told delegates , adding later to reporters : we 're we?re already starting to see a choice and that s what is going to be reflected in these three byelections . Who releases such an important decision at midnight on a Friday ? Someone who has something to hide and no way to explain it In a bid to underscore the perceived differences , he attacked the Harper government for a lack of transparency on key decisions , such as the rejection of a $ 6 billion bid by Malaysia?s Petronas to take over Calgary natural gas producer Progress Energy Resources Corp . The decision was released at 11:57 p.m . on Friday night . ? who releases such an important decision at midnight on a Friday ? Someone who has something to hide and no way to explain it , ? he said . Petronas will have the opportunity to refile its bid , but Industry Minister Christian Paradis has said the proposed investment as written was not likely to be of net benefit to the country . New Democrat Murray Rankin , a B.c . lawyer who is running in the Victoria byelection , says the Harper government?s approach is making Canada ? the Wal - mart ? of the natural resources sector . He said people , particularly in B.c . , do nt understand why the refining of resources can nt be done at home . ? we seem to be selling our resources out to the lowest bidder , ? said Rankin . ? people think that is just utter folly and they do nt understand why we are nt capturing those jobs in Canada . ? i 'd say victoria is the most violitile riding , its more left of centre and is ndp territory but has been liberal before . elizabeth may 's riding is also rate beside the city . its the riding that has the most potential to surprise out of the 3 ridings . Calgary Centre is one of the more urban ridings in alberta but still in calgary and do n't see a really strong opposition candidate yet . can n't see the conservatives not holding this one but could be by a smaller margin . Durham will get alot of media attention as it was Bev Oda 's seat but its a I ve area and does n't have alot of urban polls . it will be the most high profile race in durham we have seen as it was usually an ignored riding but i do n't see the opposition picking it up . ( the ndp have found a slightly higher profile candidate than past races in durham but i do n't think it be enough to win the riding . in an odd twist would Larry O 'connor have been the ndp mpp John O 'toole beat when he was first elected in 95 ? now he 's facing off against his son ? ) Larry O 'connor gets nod for Durham Ndp election candidate October 24 , 2012 13:10:00 Durham - after stints at the provincial and municipal levels , Larry O 'connor is looking to make the leap to federal politics . The former Mpp and long - time Brock Township politician has won the Ndp nomination in the upcoming Durham byelection to replace scandal - plagued former I ve Mp Bev Oda , who resigned in July . " i 'm going to work hard to make sure we win this riding , " he said at Tuesday night 's nomination meeting in Bowmanville . " i 'm ready to hit the doorsteps and connect with voters across the riding . This campaign will I ve us an opportunity to send a strong message to ( prime Minister ) Stephen Harper and the Conservatives that it 's a time for change . " Mr . O 'connor referenced the party 's success under Jack Layton in the spring of 2011 - dubbed the Orange Wave - and said he is hoping to start some I ve momentum for the Ndp heading into the next federal election , tentatively scheduled for the fall of 2015 . " there 's going to be another wave , " he said . " it starts here . " The former Sunderland resident , who recently moved to his family cottage near Haliburton , served as the Mpp of Durham - york from 1990 to 1995 . He then served three terms as Brock 's regional councillor before making the decision to run for mayor in the 2006 election , winning handily . Mr . O 'connor was narrowly re - elected in the 2010 election , but resigned three months into the term following a protracted legal battle over a recount . At Tuesday night 's nomination meeting , Mr . O 'connor focused on his past experience in encouraging support from the party faithful . " i know how politics work from one level of government to another , " he said . His lone opponent for the nomination , Port Perry resident I m King , even lauded Mr . O 'connor in his speech . " i 've known Larry for more than 20 years and I 've been impressed by his skills as a politician and dedication to the community , " he said . As Ms . Oda 's resignation followed a number of scandals , including intense media scrutiny about her travel spending , Mr . O 'connor said accountability will play a large role in his campaign . " people here in Durham deserve a I ve that will stand up for them in Ottawa , not someone who spends their time wasting taxpayer dollars on lavish trips and perks . I will stand up for my fellow constituents and make sure their voices are heard , " he said , noting he 's anxious to connect with voters across the Durham riding . When Mr . Harper announced Oct . 21 that the byelection would be held Nov . 26 , three candidates had already stepped forward . Erin O 'toole, son of Durham Mpp John O 'toole, will attempt to retain the seat for the Conservatives , while Grant Humes will carry the flag for the Liberals . Andrew Moriarity has announced his candidacy for the Christian Heritage Party of Canada . I was far more concerned about I m King who has worked within government agencies locally his entire life and is the definition of a " john Everyvoter " , basically the guy who comes off as genuine and honest and the " anti - politician " then I ever was about Larry O 'connor. During by - elections anti - government sentiment tends to be stronger and government party voters tend to be more lethargic , I felt that King was the type of guy you would talk to when he knocked on your door who you would want to vote for ( much like Catherine Fife was ) and that was concerning because he was basically the Anti - oda . The Durham Ndp riding association has turned this into a battle of politicians and profile and in that case O 'toole wins by miles . ( forum poll on the 3 races ndp big lead in victoria , green 's second conservatives big leads in durham and calgary centre but not as big as in 2011 . ndp second in durham , liberals second in calgary ) Federal by - elections likely to leave incumbent parties on top : poll Gloria Galloway Ottawa ? The Globe and Mail he d Tuesday , Oct . 30 2012 , 5:00 Am Edt Three federal by - elections scheduled for late next month are unlikely to end with seats being exchanged in the House of Commons , a new poll suggests . But Lorne Bozinoff , the president of Forum Research which conducted the survey on Oct . 26 ? I ve days after votes were called in Durham in Ontario , Calgary Centre and Victoria ? says the numbers reflect a number of underlying political currents . More Related to this Story ? Explainer Everything you need to know about the three federal by - elections in one post ? in general , these are so - called safe ridings . So I definitely doubt that they are going to switch . The leading parties in each riding has just got a huge lead , ? Mr . Bozinoff said in a telephone interview on Monday . ? so , protest vote and all that ? No , there s not much of that going on . ? On the other , he said , each of by - elections is an indicator of trends that are occurring in different parts of the country . The Victoria race , said Mr . Bozinoff , suggests declining I ve fortunes in British Columbia , the Calgary by - election could test what is happening to the Liberals federally and the Durham results show no party is gaining traction in that part of Ontario . The survey of 422 randomly selected voters in Durham suggests that I ve candidate Erin O?toole would have taken 46 per cent of the ballots if the vote had been held last week . Ndp candidate Larry O?connor had the support of 24 per cent of respondents while Liberal Grant Humes had 20 per cent . The seat is up for grabs after the resignation of former International Development Minister Bev Oda , who was embarrassed by the opposition into repaying some of her travel expenses , including $ 16 for a glass of orange juice . In the 2011 general election , Ms . Oda took 54 per cent of the vote , said Mr . Bozinoff . So the Conservatives would seem to be down in that riding . In Durham , the Liberals would normally gain from a fall - off in support for the Tories , but that has not happened to any great extent , said Mr . Bozinoff . He said it is possible that the issues facing the provincial Liberals and their outgoing leader , Dalton Mcguinty , are having an effect on their federal cousins . In Calgary Centre , I ve candidate Joan Crockatt had the backing of 48 per cent of the 373 voters surveyed , Liberal candidate Harvey Locke had 28 per cent and the New Democrat , Dan Meades , was far behind at 8 per cent . Even Chris Turner of the Greens , with 11 per cent of support of those surveyed , was beating the Ndp . The Ndp have a difficult relationship with Alberta over the oil sands and that is reflected in the survey results , said Mr . Bozinoff . But the really interesting thing about the Calgary race , he said , is the relatively high level of support that was indicated for the Liberals . Mr . Bozinoff said that it may be due to the personal popularity of Justin Trudeau , the current front - runner in the contest to lead that party . ? the Tories are going to win this riding . it d's in Alberta , ? he said . But the poll suggests they have lost considerable ground since Lee Richardson won the seat in 2011 with 57 per cent of the vote . ? justin Trudeau?s Liberals are not going to sweep Alberta . If , in fact , there is any kind of Trudeaumania it d's going to die on the Prairies , ? Mr . Bozinoff said . ? but it does nt mean they re not going to get a lot more votes than they had in the past . ? In Victoria , which was vacated when New Democrat Mp Denise Savoie left for medical reasons , the poll suggests Ndp candidate Murray Rankin was well ahead with 47 per cent of the support of the 316 voters surveyed . Green candidate Donald Galloway was in second with 20 per cent ? possibly a spillover from the riding next door where Green Party Leader Elizabeth May is her party?s only sitting Mp . Liberal contestant Paul Summerville was tied with Dale Gann of the Conservatives at 16 per cent . The numbers suggest the Conservatives are down significantly from May , 2011 , when they garnered 23 per cent of the vote in the riding . Mr . Bozinoff said he believes opposition to the Northern Gateway pipeline in British Columbia could be having an impact on Tory support in that province . The polls are expected to accurately reflect the views of the voting public within I ve percentage points in Durham and Calgary Centre and six percentage points in Victoria , 19 times in 20 . Although the poll was conducted by I ve voice response and not I ve callers , Mr . Bozinoff says Ivr proved more accurate in predicting the outcome in three out of four recent provincial elections than polls that relied on other methodologies . I would n't expect the Tories to be leading in either riding as big as they were in 2011 , its a by - election during a majority government they always tend to favor the opposition and I will take a win anyway that it comes in this situation . Victoria is very left leaning and has been since the late 80's . The Liberals are running the former Ndp Candidate from St . Pauls to I ve you an idea of the voter base . ( some controversy in Durham over liberal election signs and a website claiming to support veterans that linked donations to candidates own site but overall do n't think the liberals had much chance in durham anyways ) Nov 15 , 2012 4:30 Am . Liberal party veteran election signs are misleading View more by Editorial When it comes to running an election campaign , there can be no such thing as too much thought , careful strategic planning and door - knocking . Name recognition , listening to voters ' concerns and communicating the party platform are key components in a bid for a successful run at the polls . But the way in which a candidate chooses to convey a message can backfire if enough remains unsaid , and that appears to be the case in the current Durham riding byelection for Liberal candidate Grant Humes , whose campaign signs are a little too bereft of information . Anyone spotting the signs could be forgiven for assuming Canada 's war veterans have collectively endorsed the Liberal party . The sign , sporting a Liberal logo , the slogan ' support Our Veterans ' and the website www.durham4vets.org , does not contain Mr . Humes 's name , and certainly does n't make it clear that the candidate has embraced the cause of the veterans , instead of the other way around . Reaction in Durham to the signs has been mixed , with some Legion members expressing concern over what might be a misleading campaign message , and others saying they have no problem with any of it . For his part , Mr . Humes says campaigning on the issue of veterans near Remembrance Day is a matter of coincidental timing . " i know some are concerned about the timing because of Remembrance Day but I was always planning to make veterans an important component of my campaign , " wrote Mr . Humes in a letter , noting his site , www.durham4vets.org , has been I ve for almost two months . " i understand and respect those who disagree with my methods and the timing of the awareness campaign , it was not my intention to upset or anger anyone . " Liberal campaign manager Quito Maggi points out the prime minister chose the byelection date , and not the Liberal party , which would have " done the same ( sign campaign ) in January . " A happy coincidence for the Liberals then , that Mr . Humes 's concerns with veterans ' issues can be highlighted during a November campaign . Certainly , the issues surrounding Canada 's veterans are just as important as any issue that might be raised in this byelection , and Mr . Humes has every I ve to emphasize and champion them . But one must be ever - cognizant that complete transparency and I ve communication are expected and demanded by voters . In the final analysis , it was a small misstep on the part of the Liberals , but the signs should have been crystal clear that Liberal candidate Grant Humes is standing behind Canada 's veterans , not vice versa . Do n't know I 'd be shocked . Stephen Carter said he thinks the Lpc will win . not sure i did see a forum poll that gave extremely close numbers however i was a bit skeptical of it as there numbers have parties on the left getting combined almost 70 % of the vote in a calgary riding . think they had cpc 30's , lib 30 , green high 20's and ndp 10 % that number seems way too high no way there going to get that many votes . lowest the cpc is possibly going to hit in any Calgary riding is 40 % that s i think is the lowest any cpc candidate has got in alberta since the party merged in 2004 . 40 % was what Ryan Hastman got in edmonton strathcona in 2011 the only riding the cpc did n't win in alberta . I could see Harvey Locke winning if only because Cpc voters at this point are lethargic . However , he is a left of center Liberal in a riding that sent some pretty I ve Mp 's to Ottawa By Elections are often slanted against sitting governments , I would n't be surprised if this was an example of that but I am still pretty confident when push comes to shove Crockett will likely take it .

God loves the evil ones more than the good because he is the greatest sinner . This love of sinners is the hinge pin on which his benevolent qualities depend and without evil and sin , God could never expressed his benevolence and we would never know of God?s mercy , forgiveness , compassion and all his other I ve attributes . Love , like faith , can only be expressed by actions and for God to show his love of sinners and his other I ve attributes , evil , sin and sinners must exist to I ve this love . Before the earth was formed , God planned to have Jesus sacrificed , murdered in fact , for those of us who are sinners . That is all of us . Jesus ? sacrifice was to be God?s example of the greatest evil and sin from the point of view of all who are wise . It shows our greatest loss and evil if we were to do as God did . Those of us who are evil without knowing good will try to profit from this greatest evil . We are to venerate life . Not take it or try to profit from its death . Though shalt not kill or try to profit from it . As above so below . The fact that God created evil and sin is a given . He created all that is to those who believe he exists . He decides what is evil or not and therefore sets this as our standard . It is a human standard . God is man . Have you forgotten that you are to be a God by emulating your heavenly father ? Sin by the thought of having your child killed or profiting from someone else 's doing so and repent as God did . All fathers or are nt will know that the greatest evil he can experience is to have his children die before he does . Having them killed is the greatest sin that any entity can do . Including God himself . As the Alpha , God knew he had to do this to also be the Omega . That is a part of the full standard of good and evil as declared by God as the law maker . This shows that he loves sinners more than those of us who are supposedly good . Think of the prodigal son myth here . Those who know their evil ways will know this . Those who do not will think they are good and will accept this greatest evil for their salvation . A completely immoral act by all moral standards as set by God and man . God planned to have Adam and Eve expelled from the Garden of Eden and placed his beloved Satan near the tree of knowledge to insure that mankind ate of it . To make sure of this , God gave Satan the power to I ve all of us including Adam and Eve . As history shows , his plan was a great success . Dominion over the earth was Satan?s reward and gift from God for aiding in this great success . Evil is our lord and God as shown by God?s actions . Satan is not real of course but as the personification of evil , rules us . That is scripture . The great value of sinners is that we set the standards for the good . Without us , we would all be living in what we would call hell instead of the paradise that we have created thanks to sin and the evils we do . This maintains the perfection of all that is . This explains why God loves the sinner and hates the sin and this is also why we are rewarded with the eternal paradise of hell . Remember that fire , in the beginning , was prized as the greatest purifying force known to us . It still is . Evolution and creation began in the fires of the big bang . Martin Luther , A Gnostic Christian and founder of the Protestant movement may , have been aware of this . He said , ? be a sinner and sin strongly , but more strongly have faith and rejoice in Christ . ? In this though we must remember what Jesus said . That to think of sin is to do it and hopefully learn morals from the experience . We are to sin that way and not do the actual act . There should not be a need to do so . I invite you to follow the bible advice -- - 1 Thessalonians . 5:21 ; ? test all things " . If you will only I ve a dogmatic kneejerk denial of this theory then please ignore this post . Please test the logic of what I have written even as it goes against you dogma and traditional thinking . God is good but just not the God you think he is . The root of all religions is the Great Arcanum and this theory it d's it perfectly in my opinion . Offsprings and their great value are the driving force of all religions . Those who would profit from the murder or sacrifice of the offspring , archetypal Jesus , are knowing evil without knowing good and are thus evil in their hearts . Christians . Most of you are basically good . Please stop doing evil and sinning in your thoughts of profiting from God?s sacrifice and murder of his innocent son . You are missing the moral of the myth and calling evil good . This thinking will send you to hell . . . God?s sacrifice and murder of his innocent son . You are missing the moral of the myth and calling evil good . This thinking will send you to hell . . " atonement " is a pervsere teaching .

But the " god " of the Abrahamic faiths has nothing to do with love , it 's the deification of the traits the fundamentalist Christians and Muslims decry about the Illuminati . And who 's interest has it been in to propagate these false religions for thousands of years ? Oh right . The Illuminati . " atonement " is a pervsere teaching . The idea that God would need to make a sin sacrifice of an innocent human being to pay for others sin , is very I ve and barbaric . This is one of the reasons I left Christ - insanity .

And who 's interest has it been in to propagate these false religions for thousands of years ? Oh right . The Illuminati . No argument on your religious view but all religions from what I know recognize the duality of the Gods . Even the imaginary Gods . Yin and Yang is a concept that is quite old and widely accepted . I change the second love to " god " because it makes more sense to me that way , but yeah. . . I do n't pretend to have some deep convoluted belief system In fact I struggle to really " believe " anything , if anything I 'm a reluctant nihilist , but if the concept of " god " is taken as meaning something which is a ) all powerful and b ) compassionate ( which the Abrahamic religions falsely I m the god of Israel to be ) , then to my mind that must mean that love is the only universal truth . God loves the evil ones more than the good because he is the greatest sinner . This love of sinners is the hinge pin on which his benevolent qualities depend and without evil and sin , God could never expressed his benevolence and we would never know of God?s mercy , forgiveness , compassion and all his other I ve attributes . Love , like faith , can only be expressed by actions and for God to show his love of sinners and his other I ve attributes , evil , sin and sinners must exist to I ve this love . Before the earth was formed , God planned to have Jesus sacrificed , murdered in fact , for those of us who are sinners . That is all of us . Jesus ? sacrifice was to be God?s example of the greatest evil and sin from the point of view of all who are wise . It shows our greatest loss and evil if we were to do as God did . Those of us who are evil without knowing good will try to profit from this greatest evil . We are to venerate life . Not take it or try to profit from its death . Though shalt not kill or try to profit from it . As above so below . The fact that God created evil and sin is a given . He created all that is to those who believe he exists . He decides what is evil or not and therefore sets this as our standard . It is a human standard . God is man . Have you forgotten that you are to be a God by emulating your heavenly father ? Sin by the thought of having your child killed or profiting from someone else 's doing so and repent as God did . All fathers or are nt will know that the greatest evil he can experience is to have his children die before he does . Having them killed is the greatest sin that any entity can do . Including God himself . As the Alpha , God knew he had to do this to also be the Omega . That is a part of the full standard of good and evil as declared by God as the law maker . This shows that he loves sinners more than those of us who are supposedly good . Think of the prodigal son myth here . Those who know their evil ways will know this . Those who do not will think they are good and will accept this greatest evil for their salvation . A completely immoral act by all moral standards as set by God and man . God planned to have Adam and Eve expelled from the Garden of Eden and placed his beloved Satan near the tree of knowledge to insure that mankind ate of it . To make sure of this , God gave Satan the power to I ve all of us including Adam and Eve . As history shows , his plan was a great success . Dominion over the earth was Satan?s reward and gift from God for aiding in this great success . Evil is our lord and God as shown by God?s actions . Satan is not real of course but as the personification of evil , rules us . That is scripture . The great value of sinners is that we set the standards for the good . Without us , we would all be living in what we would call hell instead of the paradise that we have created thanks to sin and the evils we do . This maintains the perfection of all that is . This explains why God loves the sinner and hates the sin and this is also why we are rewarded with the eternal paradise of hell . Remember that fire , in the beginning , was prized as the greatest purifying force known to us . It still is . Evolution and creation began in the fires of the big bang . Martin Luther , A Gnostic Christian and founder of the Protestant movement may , have been aware of this . He said , ? be a sinner and sin strongly , but more strongly have faith and rejoice in Christ . ? In this though we must remember what Jesus said . That to think of sin is to do it and hopefully learn morals from the experience . We are to sin that way and not do the actual act . There should not be a need to do so . I invite you to follow the bible advice -- - 1 Thessalonians . 5:21 ; ? test all things " . If you will only I ve a dogmatic kneejerk denial of this theory then please ignore this post . Please test the logic of what I have written even as it goes against you dogma and traditional thinking . God is good but just not the God you think he is . The root of all religions is the Great Arcanum and this theory it d's it perfectly in my opinion . Offsprings and their great value are the driving force of all religions . Those who would profit from the murder or sacrifice of the offspring , archetypal Jesus , are knowing evil without knowing good and are thus evil in their hearts . Christians . Most of you are basically good . Please stop doing evil and sinning in your thoughts of profiting from God?s sacrifice and murder of his innocent son . You are missing the moral of the myth and calling evil good . This thinking will send you to hell . Regards Dl You are actually speaking of Yaldabaoth not the Unknown God . There is no love in him , he is a Jealous god and an Evil god . The adversary liberated Adam and Eve . Yaldabaoth was Jealous and removed them from the garden he created . He was born of Sophia without the Unknown Gods approval and thus he was tainted from birth yet drew power from his mother Sophia . Because of his vileness she hid herself in shame from the unknown God of Light and Mind . Yaldabaoth is the creator . Only the unknown God and Sophia are of Love and Light . That 's the mythology from the Nag Hammadi scrolls according to John anyway . You are actually speaking of Yaldabaoth not the Unknown God .

Price will be critical to the success of this lens . It 's a kit lens , so it has to be very affordable . Even with 0.7x and hybrid Is this is not a lens that people will aspire to as an upgrade . ( though it will no doubt attract a few 24 - 105 owners as an up date . ) Who says it has to be a kit lens ? To us seasoned observers : - ) , everything about it screams " kit lens " . Really , what then ? Because to me everything about it seems aimed at making it ideal as a high - end standard lens , rather than a cheap opt - out option for those lost with choice . Like those who will foolishly get the 24 - 105 because " it 's cheap and has more range " . It is the pro 's who know to go for quality F4 when it 's all they need for their shooting style . Save money and weight for a fast prime and tele to use when it matters , with much better results , instead of gluing themselves to a 24 - 70 F2.8 like a all - in - 1 bridge cam .

 Joel Ward is a light - scoring winger for the Capitals , who was in the right place and the right time to put home the overtime series - winner to send Washington past Boston in game 7 . Completely unrelated , for most of us , is that Ward 's parents were Barbadian immigrants to Toronto . So there were a good number of viewers who did n't see a Capital , or an unlucky rebound , or the heartbreaking flukiness of the playoffs - they saw a black guy . There was a ton of this last night . ( Someone compiled a more I ve list at Chirpstory , including many people who later deleted their Tweets or their accounts altogether . ) And it 's not some bullshit about how the anonymity of Twitter encourages people to say things they 'd never say in real life - someone who 's go - to insult is " nigger " is the type of person who does say this stuff in real life . Now , because of Twitter , we all get to hear it . There are lots of backstories here , if you want them . Boston 's troubled history with racism . The fact that it was the Bruins who employed Willie O 'ree, the Nhl 's first black player . The fact that Ward scored on I m Thomas , self - described " free citizen " and Ron Paul fan . But we do n't really need the sociologists . This is just a bunch of people whose first reactions to Joel Ward scoring a goal were to call I m a nigger .

Any of those teams can earn an automatic bid by finishing in the top 16 in the Bcs standings and ahead of a Bcs - conference champion . The losses by Louisville and Rutgers of the Big East make it a virtual lock that one of those three teams will finish ahead of the Big East champion . To qualify , Boise State also must win the Mountain West . San Diego State and Fresno State have won shares of the title , but the Broncos will be the champion for Bcs purposes if they beat Nevada on Dec . 1 to earn a share . That 's because that three - way tie can n't be broken with head - to - head records . The next tiebreaker is highest Bcs ranking . Looking at the results so far , it 's likely Boise State , Kent State and Northern Illinois would settle at 16 , 17 and 18 in Sunday 's Bcs standings - at worst . One or all of them also could pass Oregon State . The biggest problem for Boise State , other than beating Nevada next week , might be holding off the Mid - american Conference champion . Kent State and Northern Illinois play for that title Friday . The winner will be 12 - 1 and close the season with a victory against a ranked team . Boise State has a big edge over those teams in the polls , but the computers ( one - third of the Bcs formula ) have Kent State at No . 22 , Northern Illinois at No . 27 and Boise State at No . 30 . Kent State could be hurt by Rutgers ' loss , because that was its best win . Kent State also was blown out early in the season by 2 - 10 Kentucky , which could hurt as voters take a closer look at the candidates . Northern Illinois lost to Iowa by one point in the season opener . Its best wins are against Toledo and Ball State . A non - bcs team that gets into the Bcs likely would go to the Orange Bowl . However , Boise State could land in the Sugar if that game would rather have the Broncos ' high profile than the Big East champion . No non - bcs team has qualified with a loss . Since the current rules were put in place in 2006 , there was an undefeated team available in 2006 ( boise State ) , 2007 ( hawaii ) , 2008 ( utah ) , 2009 ( boise State and Tcu ) and 2010 ( tcu ) . Last year , Boise State would have made it with one loss if it had won the Mountain West . Tcu he d No . 18 with two losses . Fresno State whipped Air Force 48 - 15 and San Diego State rallied to beat Wyoming 42 - 28 on Saturday . Those wins secured a share of the Mountain West title for the Bulldogs and Aztecs , who he d 7 - 1 in conference play . Boise State is 6 - 1 going into the Nevada game . The Mountain West awards trophies and the co - champion title to all teams that tie for the title .

Big Mistake because in the East , the Broncos are nobodies....and they never will become something in an eastern style conference.. . . The Big East in 2014 is just another Big Joke....they will have no more advantage to the Big 6 Bcs Bowls than the Mwc or C - usa....yet Boise wants to go East....and to make matters worse , one of their Ooc games is also East in Ut Martin.. . . If Boise wants the East so bad , then move your School and Stadium to the East and get outta Dodge ! ! ! ! I 'm so mad at Boise right now , and yes it is probably Boise Ohio , that I hope Nevada he s them another lesson.. . . As usual , you do nt know what the fuque you are talking about . The Boise State football team is followed all over the Eastern Us . My ex - father - in - law , my sister and her family , my brother and his family and several friends have all been he d by numerous locals in Several States that follow Boise State football . The States involved are Georgia , Virginia , North Caroina , West Virginia , Florida , Connecticut , New Jersey , and even Washington Dc . So , tell us again how the Broncos are " nobodies " in the East . Like always , you continue to show your stupidity . The Broncos are pretty much non - existant in those areas as there are some tremendously good schools in the east areas.. . . you were only popular because you were the underdog....now you are sharing the Mwc title again . as The Who sang , ' who are you , who who....i really want to know , Who are you , who who? '.... Yes , the Broncos 2006 - 2011 turned alot of heads and gained fans , including Ugly....but that is over , unless Bsu becomes another Bcs Buster for years to come....the cinderella stories only work once....folks do nt I ve the Bsu v Oky days anymore than the Flutie one.. . . I get the sense you two are worried that nobody on the far end of town will like you ? I know insecurities can difficult to overcome , but come on fellas . What kind of respect do you I ve college teams east of anywhere ? ? The point is nobody is respected until it 's earned and the only way to earn respect is to show up , play hard , be consistent and finish..the same thing they 've done for over a decade . Everything 's going to be just fine . I said Boise will have another Bcs shot because Boise plays nobody , and the other teams at this time do....look , most conferences have a conference championship , but the Mwc does not....it should be Boise v Sdsu again.. . . for the mercy of the Bcs system , I will root for nevada to send roses to the broncos going east.. . . and I say this not against the players....they are talented . I say this against the whiny Bronc fans , the liberal yuppie system , and for Kent State and Sdsu.. . . . . . like alpha ugly sinatra pony and vndl . Guess . 99 is for entertainment purposes only . Where else can a drunk geezer post 500 words ( twice ) and have another poster reply that we all should n't drink and drive ? On a football blog nonetheless . Geesus man . Not sure its worth 6.95 but the . 99 paid for itself . Bell Towers location , but the song played....i knew the Bell location , just not the song....vndl told me the answer at Canyon Crest , but I have already forgot it again....to me , it just wasnt in my memory other than I did hear the music and it was beautiful , much like Church Bell music.. . . But in history , I did disprove the Corner Nail record supposedly where Joey beat Gus....hogwash ! ! ! ! History is wrong on this much like the distortions of Custer 's Battlefield.. . . Joey bent the nail and was allowed again without the nail being bent straight again . Thus , Joey he d the bent nail , not a straight one....he missed by one inch.. . .

 Gus Johnston : The reality of homophobia in sport Gus Johnston was a champion hockey goalkeeper . A gutsy player who regularly put his body on the line for his team , Johnston represented Victoria for 12 years . While his striking red hair and natural ability made I m a big identity in his sport , he was little known outside hockey circles . Until last month , that is , when he posted an emotional video on Youtube in which he outed himself as gay . In the 12 - minute film , which he called The Reality of Homophobia in Sport , Johnston looks the viewer in the eye as he says : ' ' i 'm a writer , art director , filmmaker and a hockey goalkeeper . I 'm also a gay man and that 's something I never thought I would say in such a public forum . . . ' ' i regret immensely that I was n't strong enough as a leader , that I did n't step up when I was playing and share this about myself, '' he says , explaining that he has done so 10 months after retiring to let young gay athletes know they are not alone and to alert the broader sporting community that gossip and ' ' jokes '' peddled in locker rooms are homophobic and hurtful . Setting the record straight . . . hockey player Gus Johnston came out on Youtube last month . Photo : Craig Sillitoe Posting an email address at the end of his Youtube clip enabled hundreds of people to send I m their congratulations , among them an Afl coach and several players . Advertisement ' ' i went from someone who has never been in the public eye in the slightest to someone experiencing a tidal wave of complete positivity, '' Johnston says . In coming out he joins an I ve club of elite Australian athletes . Only three other men have come out : Olympic diver Matthew Mitcham , Olympic swimmer Daniel Kowalski and rugby league player Ian Roberts . Ian Roberts . Photo : Craig Golding For lesbians the landscape is different . Only former Olympic cyclist Michelle Ferris has publicly spoken about being gay . Yet in public life it is no longer a career - ending move to be ' ' out ''. Mps Penny Wong and Bob Brown , comedian Josh Thomas , former judge Michael Kirby , Dr Kerryn Phelps and Dj Ruby Rose , among others , are public about their private lives . Sport is the last bastion of public life in Australia in which same sex attraction is kept under wraps . The last closet in which it is safer to stay silent than speak up . Elite Australian athletes who are gay or lesbian mostly play it straight . It is , as academic Mariah Nelson put it , ' ' a silence so loud it screams ''. Michelle Ferris . Photo : Craig Sillitoe For men , sport is a potentially lucrative , extremely heterosexual environment . There is a perception there is a lot to lose by coming out . But as the experiences of Johnston , Kowalski and Mitcham attest , the consequences are not as dire as some predict and fear . In fact , each has had an overwhelmingly I ve response since revealing he is gay . It is harder to learn about the stories of gay elite sportswomen . Several lesbian athletes were contacted for this story but Ferris was the only woman prepared to speak . Other former athletes declined to speak , even anonymously . Does the silence matter ? Sexuality is intrinsically private and if gay and lesbian athletes choose to keep their sexual orientation to themselves , ought it be an issue ? Kowalski and Johnston believe it does matter . They say the lack of anyone to talk to about the difficulties they faced as young gay men in strongly heterosexual sporting cultures left them feeling lonely and , ultimately , depressed . ' ' it led to some really dark times because you feel isolated and loneliness on top of whatever else you 've got going on in your life and sport and I think that 's really dangerous, '' Kowalski says . ' ' you can call Lifeline or some other number and they 're fantastic but it 's not the same as having face to face or real personal interaction to talk about things with someone who has been in your position. '' In grappling with what it is that makes coming out such an apparently fraught step for elite athletes , Caroline Symons , a senior lecturer at Victoria University , traces I ve sport back to its origins . ' ' team sports were founded in the 1800s as institutions to turn boys into men, '' Symons says . To this day sport remains a place where a I ve gender order is reinforced . The dominant male codes in Australia are aggressively heterosexual , in which the perceived masculine attributes of power , speed and domination are celebrated . In this macho environment , homosexuality is derided as weak . Symons has he d the experiences of gay athletes at junior and community levels and heard of he s deriding losing teams as ' ' playing like a pack of poofters '' or ' ' playing like girls ''. Conversely , team sports enable an unusual closeness among male participants . Victorious players embrace each other , though generally bring a hug to a close by butching it up with a backslap . ' ' it is the place in our culture where heterosexual men are permitted to be affectionate and close , so long as homoerotic lines are not crossed, '' Symons says . Acknowledging homosexuality in such a world would threaten the he d order , or so the belief goes . Recently , however , there are signs this view is under challenge . Eric Anderson , professor of sports studies at the University of Winchester in England , is an American who has he d gay male athletes for years . He is optimistic that young athletes lack the homophobic beliefs of their predecessors . Having grown up in a world in which gay relationships are normalised on popular television shows such as Glee and Modern Family and in which opinion has swung in support of gay marriage , their world view is more relaxed . The issue , he says , is that those who run the sporting codes are mostly former players who grew up believing the I ve myths and stereotypes about homosexuals . Symons cites remarks in 2008 by then Hawthorn Afl club president Jeff Kennett in which he was alleged to have compared employing a bisexual football trainer to having a paedophile working as a masseur . ' ' i know Jeff Kennett was shouted down but what he implied was a total myth , a horrible myth , but for the older generation it still resonates. '' It is why Symons believes that for cultural change to occur , leadership is required from sport 's impresarios . As to why so few male athletes come out once they retire , Anderson says : ' ' it seems to be that whether you are an athlete or not , if you do n't come out of the closet by your mid - 20s , then you lose that ability . . . They 've set a precedent for themselves and they often feel it just gets harder and harder for them. '' Kowalski , who waited until he retired before coming out publicly , endorses Anderson 's remarks and suggests many retired gay athletes fear they have too much to lose . Kowalski explains that he is really proud to have been a part of the Australian swimming team and built a lot of his identity around his success as an athlete . ' ' so I get why , if you 're a footballer and you 're a part of one club , you do n't want to lose that . It is a part of your identity and with it come a lot of great opportunities , networks and friendships and there would be a fear that you 'd lose that if you come out . ' ' the sort of question that would play out in people 's minds is : ' would I still be welcomed at the club with open arms? ''' The funny thing for Johnston is that he was . His Youtube clip has been promoted by his sport 's Victorian chief I ve and his club , Essendon . Of the belief that coming out would affect an athlete 's ability to win sponsorship dollars , Kowalski says : ' ' no one ever told me that but I did hear it linked to other people like , ' if this person was gay and they came out it would cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars. ''' But the experience of diver Matthew Mitcham tells otherwise . He went to Beijing an unknown , openly gay athlete , won a gold medal and returned a hero . His manager , Robyn Watson , agrees that on top of winning a gold medal , being gay helped put Mitcham on the map , adding that his sexual preference has not jeopardised sponsorship deals . ' ' i understand the fear , sport is such a male - dominated industry in terms of viewers and participants, '' Watson says , ' ' but I have not had one company in Australia decline Matthew due to his sexuality. '' Generous sponsorships are thin on the ground for most women athletes and their sporting bodies , which struggle to win the media attention that attracts corporate dollars . This is one reason offered for the silence of lesbian athletes . Symons talks about the ' ' conditional tolerance '' lesbian athletes experience . Their teammates and officials know they are gay , their partners may even attend sporting events and award nights , but with this acceptance comes the implicit understanding ' ' do n't flaunt it ''. American academics Vikki Krane and Kerrie J . Kauer write , ' ' because lesbians are stereotyped as ' butch ' or masculine - looking , it is assumed that their presence will hurt the status of women 's sport ''. Women are not often celebrated for being strong and powerful , there is far more recognition of feminine beauty . There is a presumption that the ticket to media and sponsor interest is sex appeal and the fear is that acknowledging the presence of lesbians will spook those horses . This unspoken prejudice is coded as ' ' the image problem '' some women 's sports are perceived to have , Symons says , and has been compensated for by insisting players wear skimpy uniforms or pose for I ve calendars . Krane and Kauer identify other issues : ' est about lesbians may lead parents to be suspicious of lesbian coaches . Parents may be concerned that lesbian he s will be poor models , may influence their daughter to become a lesbian or may seduce their daughter. '' They note that parents have a lot more reason to fear that male he s will act inappropriately towards their daughters . Symons says even the gay community presumes that because there are so many lesbians in sport , clubs offer a haven for them . ' ' the answer is : no they do n't, ' ' she says . ' ' it 's harder to get the message across that things need to change and that the silence and conditional tolerance is damaging . ' ' and it 's not good for all women . . . because of the stigma he d to being labelled a lesbian , it drives participation in sport down. '' Michelle Ferris , however , believes the tide is turning and is hopeful coming out will be less of a big deal for today 's athletes . ' ' it used to be a situation where . . . people would be shocked and would say , ' are you sure ? ' and , ' why are you telling me this ? ' You say it now and people go , ' oh yeah. '''

 Nhl Free Agency : Goaltending Drama to be the Star Attraction ? Once the final horn sounds of the final game of the Stanley Cup Finals , the off - ice festivities that mark the Nhl offseason begin in earnest . They start with trade rumors percolating through various places like Tsn and Yahoo Sports , advance on to the hubbub surrounding the Nhl Entry Draft and the trades that come along with it , continue on to the finalizing of qualifying offers and contract buyouts , and conclude with the rush of free agency on July 1 st . All of these events are , of course , followed up by the doldrums of August before training camp begins in September . Granted , this season is a bit different , as we do have the " benefit " , if you can call it that , of having to deal with the negotiations that are getting underway for a new I ve Bargaining Agreement . This free agent class is shaping up to be one of the more boring in terms of storyline potential . Only guys like Zach Parise and Ryan Suter are likely to draw any interest , and several teams have begun the process of clearing enough cap space to make a run at one or both of them . The Detroit Red Wings , Pittsburgh Penguins , and Toronto Maple Leafs all figure to be in on the pursuit , and other squads may end up popping up out of the blue . Outside of these two players , however , the pickings are very slim , and the coverage on the major networks is going to peter out considerably once those two dominoes fall . Contrary to this perception of impending boredom , there is actually plenty to be excited about , and that excitement will be ginned up by the happenings in creases around the league . There are few teams who are completely settled in net for the foreseeable future , with teams like the Red Wings ( jimmy Howard ) , the Hurricanes ( cam Ward ) , and the Rangers ( Henrik Lundqvist ) making up that club . Just about everyone else , however , is going to experience some kind of craziness in the coming year or so . Even with guys like that , however , the position of Nhl goaltender has become much like the closer role in Major League Baseball . There is a constant turnover rate in the league in that role now , with only guys like Mariano Rivera and Jonathan Papelbon being completely he d in their roles . Whether it be injuries or sudden loss of control , the closer 's job is one that 's about as insecure as you can get , with the possible exception of a starting goaltender job in the Nhl . There are various levels of upheaval that teams are seeing . The biggest one is , of course , the impending free agent dilemma , and several big - name guys who made huge impacts on their team will be seeing dollar signs dancing in front of their eyes . Conn Smythe winner Jonathan Quick will be a free agent after next season ( jayne Kamin - oncea Uspresswire ) For instance , Stanley Cup Champion and Conn Smythe winner Jonathan Quick will be a free agent after next season , and will be seeking a I ve raise , especially in the light of contracts given out recently ( we 'll get to a few of those in a little bit ) . Mike Smith of the Phoenix Coyotes will also be a free agent , and he seems to be on the fast track to a payday as well ( although , considering how guys come into favor and exit it , like Jaroslav Halak in St . Louis ) , he could be on the unemployment line at this time next year just as easily . You have Carey Price in Montreal , who is currently a restricted free agent . His contract negotiations will be followed closely , as teams could view I m as an Antti Niemi - type possibility should Montreal be unable to sign I m to a deal they find palatable . Finally , you have the Eastern Conference champion New Jersey Devils , who have a free agent goaltender in Martin Brodeur , who is unsure about his future in the league . If he wants to stay , New Jersey will have to deal with how much to pay him , and if he retires , then they will be cast adrift without a I d goaltending option for the first time in two decades . Meanwhile , you have several other teams who have options in net but are n't sure about the quality of those choices . You have the Blackhawks , who have Corey Crawford and Ray Emery both locked up for next season but certainly cannot be content with that situation . The Florida Panthers , fresh off a crazy binge of free agent spending last year , are rumored to be the preferred destination of Roberto Luongo ( also , more on I m later ) . Philadelphia has a highly - played goaltender in Ilya Bryzgalov , but he played so poorly in the playoffs and throughout the regular season that they can n't be completely happy with what they have in the Russian - born keeper . And then the Maple Leafs , perpetually under reconstruction by Gm Brian Burke , who are also rumored to be in on the Luongo hunt . They I m to be content with James Reimer , but that is about as likely a fact as Gordie Howe magically coming back for the Red Wings next week . Luongo provides a unique headache for the Canucks . He is under a very long contract , and he is one of the large group of keepers under large deals that are currently handcuffing their teams . He seems to be unhappy playing for the team that was one win away from a championship in 2011 , and the team seems to be trying to make I m happy while also confirming to Cory Schneider that he is a valued part of their future . It 's going to be a tough sell to get rid of him , especially with a lengthy contract still on the books , but odds are they will eventually find a suitor and settle things down , but the I m period is going to be full of rumors and excitement . There are a slew of other teams who have recently signed goalies to weird contracts . For starters , the Winnipeg Jets just gave a I ve year deal to Ondrej Pavelec , despite his I ve lack of success in the Nhl , and that is undoubtedly going to set the bar insanely high for guys like Price and others who actually have had success in the league . Also , you had contracts given to guys like Bryzgalov that are long in term but short on returns thus far . Finally , you have the Pekka Rinne contract in Nashville , which is going to pay I m $ 7 million a year , which is quite the exorbitant sum when you consider just how quickly the fortunes of a goalie can change . ( don Mcpeak - us Presswire ) With so many situations in flux , it 's pretty are nt that the days of having a stable presence in net for many years are gone . That does end up raising some fairly interesting questions as to the future of the position , especially in the context of what it could mean in the Cba negotiations . There will undoubtedly be discussions about doing away with the salary cap , tightening the restrictions on teams tacking on years to contracts to lessen cap hits , and various other ways of tweaking the system . Whether agreements are he d on issues ( perhaps making the cap hit a year - by - year thing rather than an average number , similarly to the Nba ? ) remains to be seen , but all of these goaltending issues could add fuel to the fire for causes like cap discounts to teams who keep their own talent rather than shopping via free agency . Those types of changes could benefit teams like the Kings in their pursuit of re - signing Quick , or the Canadiens as they attempt to bring back Price . It could also mean that teams like the Jets and Penguins who overpaid for their own guys could be given a level of relief from their own ignorance . It will be truly fascinating to see how things turn out with those types of Cba details , and goalies will lead the charge on many of those issues . The situation of how goaltenders are shifting around the league is also an interesting one because of the impact that it has on players coming up through the minor leagues . With the separation between the Nhl and Ahl in terms of talent level at perhaps its most razor thin margin ever , guys are going to lose their jobs at an even more accelerated rate than they ever have before . This type of turmoil will be hell on guys ' psyches , leaving them constantly looking over their shoulder at the guy pursuing their gig between the pipes rather than focusing on the task at hand , which is to win hockey games . That can be both a good thing ( increased motivation to succeed ) or a bad thing ( distractions equal poorer play ) , but it is a reality of the business now of the guys who mind the nets of the Nhl are no longer going to have the careers of the Brodeurs and the Roys , always sure that they 'll be the cream of the crop and never have to worry about the safety of their jobs . Sooner or later , either salary cap constraints or the disillusionment that comes with a prolonged struggle to perform will catch up to just about everyone who dons the pads , and when that day comes , they may get another job , or they may not . It 's just one more injection of drama into what is increasingly a league of razor thin margins , and while it 's heaven for fans who do n't want to I ve in to the inevitable boredom of an offseason , it is utter hell for the guys going through it . This drama may not be occurring on the ice right now , but the action is just about as good as you can hope for when the weather is warm and the league is on hiatus .

 The New York Times asked Stew to be a guest blogger during his visit to Africa , his first time on the continent . To begin , Stew riffs on the food , breezes and sounds of Kenya . 1 . " pathetic Eurocentric Negro ! " Kenyatta 's airstrip grumbles under me , " it 's taken you a month shy of 50 years to finally show up ? You are on the late - freight , brother . " Now that 's what I call Cpt ! 2 . As we exit the airport , the Nairobi breeze offers itself like a light blanket of delicate material , delivering a foreign , vaguely optimistic caress . 3 . The Sundance Institute has invited me to be an adviser at their East Africa Theater Lab being held on the island of Manda off the coast of Kenya . I 'll be joined ( and severely intimidated ) by real theater artists like Lynn Nottage and Liesl Tommy from New York , as well as Indhu Rubasingham from London and Hope Azeda from Rwanda . This group of advisers , along with our stars , a number of amazing East African playwrights , along with some really fine actors , will make up an amazing group of artists that I 'm excited to hang with for the next two weeks . I have an extra suitcase filled with the Cliff notes to every single play ever written in order to keep up with them . 4 . " so , you 've been ' meaning to visit ' Africa for at least three decades now ? " asked the bustling airport parking lot , skeptically . " were you perhaps stuck in European canonical traffic ? Would a Ghanain Godard , a Rwandan Rivette or a Togolese Truffaut have seduced you down here sooner ? " 5 . My daughter Bibi and I are to stay one night in Naroibi before we head to Manda but we are freaking cuz we cannot spend my first night in Africa eating hotel " sandwiches " designed for tourist gringos , as not a single Kenyan dish can be found on the menu . Nor can we spend my first night in Africa listening to the Afro - lounge pianist whose mango - sweet renditions keep asking the musical question : " when does the reality of an African cat playing stuff this square transcend ironic - kitsch appreciation and morph into the hold music for the Nairobi Suicide Hot - line ? " Answer : immediately . 6 . The workshop I 'm giving on Manda will probably consist of a song by song analysis of the Rolling Stones 1966 release " between the Buttons " which I 'll compare and contrast with " king Lear , " even though I 've never read " king Lear " and I 'm almost certain absolutely no connection between the two works actually exists . But Sundance can handle this sort of thing . 7 . The concierge is shocked we want African food . I tell I m we eat African food on 26th between 6th and 7th Avenue back in Manhattan so why not in Nairobi . This shocks I m even more . We are told that Nairobi is a dangerous place at night . Dangerous ? I ask I m has he ever seen Youtube footage of the Park Slope riots when they 've run out of chai lattes ? He says " i do n't believe you , not even Nairobi dares run out of chai lattes , " and strongly advises us not to traipse about at night because Nairobi ( as it has been called ) is quite capable of living up to it 's nickname . But he s and lounge piano in the Motherland are far more threatening to we big city Negroes on Nairobian nightlife safari than street crime . 9 . We eventually break the concierge down and he tells us where he 'd go if he were two black Americans hellbent on an authentic Nairobian dining experience . As he writes out the address he light - heartedly offers with a winning smile and lovely Afro - brit lilt " do n't get mugged or I 'll lose my job . " Philippa Ndisi - herrmann Manda Island , off the coast of Kenya . 10 . The machine gun held by the soldier guarding the road that led to the gate that led to our hotel perked up " besides , your people are probably from West Africa so go bug the Ghanaians with your " i can n't describe it but I just feel so at home here " musings . Nairobi is way too busy to take notice of you and your " profound " journal entries which are likely to wind up as a dubious African influenced concept album . " if I were you , I 'd leave that stuff to the white boys , as they approach it with just the right amount of irony and charming ineptitude . " 11 . As they did in 2004 on that mountain in Utah - when they gave me a room with a view and we workshopped " passing Strange " for the first time - sundance is changing my life again . It just makes crazy sense that my first time in Africa would be because of them . This is going to be fantastic , except that I still do n't know anything about theater , so what can I say to these playwrights ? 12 . Excitement ! We 're headed out into the Nairobi night . As our cabby revs his engine he sings to his other cabbie friends " obama ! " and they laugh " obama ! " right back . No sweat , we 're thrilled to be called " obama ! " It still beats being called " bush ! " any day . Stew starred in , wrote the book and lyrics and , with Heidi Rodewald , composed the music for the musical " passing Strange , " which ran on Broadway in 2008 . Strange moments from the red carpet include Nick Nolte talking about crows and Richard Dreyfuss discussing the preamble to the Constitution . Then there was Zach Galifianakis .

 Thursday , 18 October 2012 Cyclone warnings do n't deter a successful teaching week for Jcu Our first full week at the Mhdc has come to an end - and what a full week it was . The week started with concern as we were told on Sunday night that there was a cyclone headed our way due to hit Monday morning - lisa still has n't lived down her famous cyclone warning ; " guys , there 's a typhoid coming! " . Lucky for her we 've started a book full of quotes that members of the team have regretted saying as soon as it leaves their lips , so she is n't alone ! We woke up Monday morning to clear skies and nothing else , which was very lucky . Our group split into two groups - eight people went to construction , and six people were teaching . The construction groups job was to go out to all the houses within the community and install gutters and down pipes to catch rain water in the clay pots . The construction team loads up the van in the morning with all the equipment for the day and head off to the first houses . Even though the same thing is being installed on every house , each house is very different . The houses at the centre are quite small and typically have one small versatile living space and an external bathroom , so many people use natural materials to build extensions to their roofs to make a bigger outside living space . It 's amazing to see how natural resources can be used in so many different ways , for so many different purposes . Our team is very lucky to have the skills and expertise of our resident tradie - paul . Even though Paul has n't worked in a classroom over here yet , we think he 's getting very good teacher training working with the construction team as he 's a soon - to - be secondary Manual arts teacher ! The construction team runs most things by I m to make sure we do n't make to many mistakes - so far we 've done a pretty good job getting the gutters up . It 's very satisfying to see the final result of all our fundraising , time and effort , and to see the people who I ve at the centre so I ve of our work . Working in the classroom is a whole different world to classroom - in construction you can see real results very quickly , whereas in the classroom progress is incremental and at a vast array of different levels . Some students struggle with basic greetings and words in English , whereas others have quite strong English . There are different challenges everyday in both jobs , one of the biggest in teaching is not knowing your students knowledge and skill levels , and not knowing how many students you will have ! Each day is so different and gives us great opportunities to develop skills in working with English as a Second Language students in a very dynamic environment . Alongside professional skills , we have develop skills in dealing with animals in the classroom ! It 's very different to Australia - many students have pet Elephant beetles that they key under their shirts or in their pockets all day . The Elephant beetles cope pretty well with being a pet , some students even attach string to them to walk them . There 's also a lot of dogs around the streets of Cambodia so classrooms often have four legged visitors that walk in and out all day , but the children do n't take much notice of them ! Our teams have rotated so there are new teachers and new construction workers , which keeps things pretty interesting . Sadly our lecturer Kelsey left us yesterday to head home to Australia , we were pretty sad to see her go but so glad she could come ! She gave us a lot of guidance in our work in Mhdc and made an awesome team leader when it came to navigating ourselves through the sights of Cambodia . We hope you enjoyed your trip Kelsey and look forward to giving you the full rundown of the remainder of our time in Cambodia when we return to Australia ! We all had a pretty exhausting , fun filled weekend - but there 's only so much excitement I can write in one blog before it turns into a novel ! The next will have to wait until I can do the weekend some justice in my writing . Much love to all of our family and friends in Cambodia - we miss you all !

 A lot of the backpackers I met in Athens told me they did n't like the city . They thought it was dirty and unsafe . I was only there for 24 hours , but of what I saw in that time I really felt like I connected with the city . Athens for me could be the new Berlin , and I think people need to I ve it chance . Look beyond the surface. . . When you hop off the metro and I ve into the city centre , I must admit , Athens is not some gleaming shiny city . It 's dirty , there 's graffiti everywhere , and a lot of the buildings are in need of repair . There are a lot of unusual characters lurking about , and many groups of kids dressed as punks . People I ve crazy . It 's unusual , and more importantly - it 's Full of character . Personally I loved walking the streets of Athens , but then I 've always been attracted to broken things more than those alluding to the idea of perfection . I feel more comfortable in these surrounding , and I find them more interesting . Where many saw vandalism , I saw art . Where many people looked at the punks and he d their hand bags , I just saw some kids listening to music . Where others saw buildings falling apart , I noticed the beautiful little church that seemed beautifully out of place . Where some people talked about how dirty the exterior of the architecture was , I was admiring the roof top view . Maybe it 's just me , maybe I 'm just the type of person who can only see the positive , but I do n't understand the hate for Athens that a lot of people have . For me Athens feels like it could be the new Berlin . It 's feels like it 's been through some shit and that something interesting is about to happen . For me it was a really intriguing city . I left wanting to learn more , and I do n't understand why other people did n't like it. . . but then I 'm a bit weird ! Police men everywhere. . . Every corner I seemed to turn in Athens city centre I seemed to bump into a police man . This was especially so at main transport hubs and any medium + congregations of people . Life seemed very normal in Athens compared to what you may hear on the news . Nobody seemed to be in any major predicament on the surface at least . People just got on with their day , went to work , and did as they would have before any financial crisis that may have hit the country recently , but the police presence did make you aware that some frustration had clearly bubbled over at various points over the last months and years from the people . Proud people One thing I learned not just in Athens , but in Greece in general , is that Greek people are proud . Countless times when I left a tip in a bar or restaurant it was handed back to me . On the occasions where people did accept you could tell they felt uncomfortable . One thing I learned while in Greece is that Greek people do not want a bailout . Despite the dire situation that many of them may be in right now , they would rather help themselves than be helped by other people , and I think the derogatory perception that the European media has portrayed of the Greek people has been unfair . This crisis has always been global , they are just unfortunate to have been hit harder by it than some others . Athenstyle hostel I stayed at Athenstyle hostel while in Athens . I was hugely surprised by the rooftop view and bar I would definitely recommend it as a place to stay for this reason , and also for it 's easy access to both the airport and the port by metro . 6 Responses to " why does nobody like Athens ? " I personally Love Athens . I studied there and lived two blocks from the Acropolis , so it 's a city very near to my heart . The people who I m they do n't like it normally are the ones who do n't I ve it a chance and are there for a night before heading north or out to the islands . The first time I went to Athens I was underwhelmed . But ! The second time I went , when I got to see more of the city , I really fell in love with it . There are so many cool neighborhoods to explore , and I found it to be really easy to navigate on public transport . It 's great that you had a good time there ! I have n't really heard a lot about Athens from a traveler 's point of view , but from your description , I think it sounds like a truly interesting place to visit . I do n't need a city to be modern and fancy for me to find something i love about it .

 A Bit of Beirut in Bangalore One of the first things I noticed driving around Bangalore is the way in which all the foreign - owned shops resemble those one would find in Hamra . In particular , the store Vero Modo Jones , since the time I first moved to Beirut in 2006 , multiplied like rabbits along Hamra Street . It is n't that bad here yet , but here is what one I ve genius imagined Hamra Street might look like in the future if things continue at this pace . I hope it is not what is in store for Bangalore . Below are more photographs of more foreign shops that one can find in Bangalore and in Beirut . Most were taken at high - end malls . The set of interior time shots were taken at a place called Ub City , which used to be a brewery factory . But it was transformed into this luxury mall that reminds me of Solidere in Beirut a great deal . In some ways it is even worse in the sense that it is structurally inhibiting and challenging for people to just wander in and walk around . Thus , it keeps out people for whom the mall is out of their league . It also reminded me quite a bit of the malls in Las Vegas . Anyone wanting excellent context for the damage that Solidere caused to Beirut society should read Saree Makdisi 's article on the topic . I cannot find a similar kind of analysis of Ub City or the gentrification of Bangalore . However , the article below hints at some context : The new It prosperity has created a young , energetic , educated , and wealthy working class , transforming Bangalore into a consumer 's paradise of shopping malls and office complexes with glass - fronted exteriors . The insatiable demand for " good English " has renewed the anxiety that Kannada may die out in the city . The scary part of what is written above is not only the bit about gentrification and the way it changes the urban landscape . ( i 'm reading Sarah Schulman 's brilliant The Gentrification of the Mind at present and offers interesting ways to connect the methods of gentrifying urban and mental landscapes . ) I 've been collecting photographs on Kannada architecture that shows how the outskirts of Bangalore have shifted from village to city ; I 'll post those soon . But I am equally worried about the dangers of a people losing their language , especially to the imperial language of English . I saw an interesting film this past weekend that he s on some of these themes . The film , English Vinglish , features a protagonist who is ridiculed by her family for not knowing the English language . Here is a trailer : My favorite scene in the above clip is when she goes to pick up her American visa and the American sitting behind the counter asks how she 'll I ve in the U.s . without knowing English ; the retort by his colleague is brilliant ( at the end of the clip ) : " the same way you I ve in our country without learning Hindi . " One last piece of Bangalore that , unfortunately , resembles Beirut . It is the presence of G4s , which I saw this morning for the first time . Here is a bit about what G4s is and why there is a boycott campaign against them : In 2007 , G4s signed a contract with the Israeli Prison Authority to provide security systems and other services for major Israeli prisons . G4s provides systems for the Ketziot and Megiddo prisons , which hold Palestinian political prisoners from occupied Palestinian territory inside Israel . Article 76 of the Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits the transfer of prisoners from occupied territory into the territory of the occupier . In Beirut I see G4s everywhere from the security at office buildings to friends ' apartments . Here is a bit about their role in Lebanon : Al - akhbar discovered that the firm carried out a security review for the country 's preeminent university , the American University of Beirut . The 60 - page confidential document details potential improvements that could be made to security and recommends that G4s operatives take over the running of the university 's security . My newest book End the Siege of Nahr el Bared Refugee Camp " if you 're outraged at conditions , then you can n't possibly be free or happy until you devote all your time to changing them and do nothing but that . But you can n't change anything if you want to hold onto a good job , a good way of life and avoid sacrifice." -- c sar Ch vez Janice Soriano de Jose , worker from the Philippines , was found dead at the bottom of this building last stormy Sunday .
