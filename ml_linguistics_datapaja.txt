1. Useful basic commands:
ls --> list all files in the directory
nano x.txt --> open t.txt in the nano text editor
cat x.txt --> print x.txt
less x.txt --> browse x.txt (return to command line by pressing q)
python program.py --> run program.py
cat x.txt | python program.py --> first print x.txt and then feed it as input for program.py
cd directory --> go the directory

2. Getting the data
type git clone https://github.com/TurkuNLP/ML_Linguistics.git to the command line
type ls and enter --> you should see a directory
type cd ML-Linguistics --> go to the directory
type ls --> you should see the files

3. Text classification

CLASSES: 0: opinion blogs, 1: discussion forum, 2: sport reports, 3: travel blogs

cat 0_ob.txt 1_df.txt 2_sr.txt 3_tb.txt | python svm.py | less --> print the files as input for svm.py, browse the results with less (back to command line with q)
3. 1. Run the classifier with the two feature sets. How are the results? Which registers are the hardest, which the easiest to detect? Which feature set was the best?
3. 2. Analyze the key features. Do they make sense? Are there some that  seem less informative? Why?
